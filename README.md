# If you are facing the error 
WARNING - That means 'too many requests'. I'll go to sleep for 5 minutes.

You should run  c:\users\sc\appdata\local\programs\python\python310\lib\site-packages  and it should work for you. If not, find your own path using these two commands
 pip list -v 
 and 
 pip show. 
Edit the file api.py then comment from lines 559 to 585 but try not to make a lot of requests to not be blocked.
